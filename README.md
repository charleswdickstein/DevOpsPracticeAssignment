# NLP Final Paper - Sentiment Analysis using Neural Networks, Logistic Regression, and Pott’s Scores
My research experimented with sentiment
analysis using Neural Networks, logistic
regression, and naive bayes based systems to
predict the ratings of Amazon product reviews.
Using over 500 thousand Amazon reviews, three
techniques for sentiment analysis were
developed to predict the rating of an Amazon
review based on text. Of the three systems a
Dense Neural Network achieved the highest
score to predict reviews by category while a
Pott’s Diagram performed the worst.
